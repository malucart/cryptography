  -- substitution cipher --
  "In cryptography, a substitution cipher is a method of encrypting by which units of plaintext are replaced with ciphertext"

  About my example, I have a code number called data_birth with 6 numbers "061842"
  (paul mccartney birthday!) also I have a data_txt which has a phase as string "HELLO THERE YOU FOUND ME" 
  the idea is to encode this phase to:
  H + 0 = H
  E + 6 = K
  L + 1 = M
  L + 8 = T
  O + 4 = S
  space + 2 = space (because anything plus space is space)
  T + 0 = T
  H + 6 = N
  E + 1 = F
  R + 8 = Z
  E + 4 = I
  space + 2 = space
  Y + 0 = Y
  O + 6 = U
  U + 1 = V
  space + 8 = space
  F + 4 = J
  O + 2 = Q
  U + 0 = U
  N + 6 = T
  D + 1 = E
  space + 8 = space
  M + 4 = Q
  E + 2 = G
  
  In other words: HKMTS TNFZI YUV JQUTE QG

var data_birth = [0,6,1,8,4,2]; //"180642"; just a random data birth
var data_txt = "HELLO THERE YOU FOUND ME";  // txt
var j = 0; // necessary to be an index in data_birth
var cipher = ""; // necessary to start: a empty string

// to go through all the values that are in txt
for (let i = 0; i < data_txt.length; i++) { 
 
  // according to ascii table 32 means " "
  if (data_txt.charCodeAt(i) == 32) { 
    cipher = cipher + " "; // every time that the program sees a space, it will keep the space
  } else { 
  		// String.fromCharCode() means converter decimal to char (ascii table)
  		// charCodeAt() means converter char to decimal (ascii table)
  		// so it gets a letter in the txt, converters it to decimal, sums a number in data_birth, and then, 
  		// comes back to char. If this char is after than Z, in the ascii table, 
  		// the new cipher will be the old cipher with a plus: 
  		// letter in txt converted to decimal - 26, because for example:
  		// I have the letter "Z" in the txt, I need change it or not (depends on the data_birth).
  		// if I have to, everything will be after Z, so it will not be a letter,
  		// for this reason, I need to come back to the beginning of the alphabet, 
  		// it means that if I put -26 will come back to the beginning and
  		// it will sum exactly what was add after Z
		if (String.fromCharCode(data_txt.charCodeAt(i) + data_birth[j]) > "Z") {
			cipher = cipher + String.fromCharCode(data_txt.charCodeAt(i) - 26);

		// same thing happen, but the difference is if the letter in txt + data_birth
		// will result in something before A, if yes, it sums +26 to continue in the alphabet
		// and adds exactly what was add to go before A, so this is the new cipher
		} else if (String.fromCharCode(data_txt.charCodeAt(i) + data_birth[j]) < "A") {
		    cipher = cipher + String.fromCharCode(data_txt.charCodeAt(i) + 26);

		// if the letter in txt + data_birth = something inside the alphabet, 
		// the new cipher is the new letter 
		} else { 
		    cipher = cipher + String.fromCharCode(data_txt.charCodeAt(i) + data_birth[j]);
		} 

    } 

  // necessary to get each value in data_birth 
  j = j + 1;
 
  // reset the "seed" for crypto 
  // so every time it "overflows" the size of data_birth 
  // it goes back to 0, as data_txt has arbitrary length and 
  // can be bigger than data_birth
  if (j >= data_birth.length) { 
    j = 0;
