  -- vigenere cipher --
  It is a method of encrypting alphabetic text based on letters.
  You can see more examples and explanation here:
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen√®re_cipher

  In my example, I have a key called ROCKET
  and I need to decrypt a text (txt_encrypt) according with this key

  If I have "S" and the first letter in the key is "R"
  A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, D = 4 [...]
  it means that S = 19 and R = 18
  so it jumps down 1 letter
  19 - 18 = 1
  starting in A, A + 1 = B
  result: with S letter and R key, the real text (plaintext) is B

  Now example with the next letter and key,
  C instead of S, O instead of R
  it means that C = 3 and O = 15
  so it jumps down 14 letters
  starting in A, A + 14 = O
  resukt: with C letter and O key, the plaintext is O

  and so on.
