'''
  -- vigenere cipher --
  It is a method of encrypting alphabetic text based on letters.
  You can see more examples and explanation here:
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VigenÃ¨re_cipher

  In my example, I have a key called ROCKET
  and I need to decrypt a text (txt_encrypt) according with this key

  If I have "S" and the first letter in the key is "R"
  A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, D = 4 [...]
  so S = 19
  Now I need to jump down 1 letter (because R = 18)
  (19 - 18) % 26 = 1
  it means that A = 1
  (because I gonna get I H G F)

  and so on.

  # if char_ascii is not the same than a letter on the key and it is not something random like "." "!" etc
