'''
  -- vigenere cipher --
  It is a method of encrypting alphabetic text based on letters.
  You can see more examples and explanation here:
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen√®re_cipher

  In my example, I have a key called ROCKET
  and I need to decrypt a text according with this key

  If I have "S" as the first letter on the text
  and "R" as the first letter on the key
  A = 0, B = 1, C = 2, D = 3 [...]
  it means that S = 18 and R = 17
  so it jumps down 1 letter
  18 - 17 = 1
  so starting in A,
  A + 1 =
  0 + 1 =
  = B
  result: with S letter and R key, the real text (plaintext) is B

  and so on.
